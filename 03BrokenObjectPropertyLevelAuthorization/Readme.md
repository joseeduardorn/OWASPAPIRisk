To address this issue, the application should implement proper authorization checks to ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to. Instead of directly referencing sensitive objects like account numbers in URLs or parameters, the application should use a session-based or role-based authorization mechanism to determine access rights dynamically.

Additionally, the application should implement access controls at the database level to enforce restrictions on which records users can access. For example, using database queries with WHERE clauses that filter results based on the user's session or role.
