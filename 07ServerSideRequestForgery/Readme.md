Mitigation: To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities, the application should:
Implement strict input validation and sanitize user-supplied URLs to prevent injection of malicious payloads.
Use whitelisting or allow-listing to restrict the domains or IP addresses from which the application can fetch resources.
Apply network-level controls, such as firewalls or network proxies, to restrict outbound requests to trusted destinations and prevent requests to internal resources.
Employ server-side protections, such as rate limiting or request throttling, to detect and block anomalous or suspicious requests.
