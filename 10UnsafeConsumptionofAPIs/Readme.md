Mitigation: To address the unsafe consumption of APIs and mitigate associated risks, the organization should:
Implement secure API key management practices, such as storing API keys securely and using environment variables or encrypted storage solutions to protect sensitive information.
Use authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 or API tokens to authenticate API requests securely.
Enforce proper authorization checks to ensure that API consumers have the necessary permissions to access specific resources or perform certain actions.
Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting or throttling to prevent abuse or excessive usage.
Regularly review and update API access controls, including revoking or rotating API keys as needed.
Educate developers and API consumers about secure API usage practices and the importance of protecting sensitive credentials and data.
