To mitigate Broken Object Level Authorization vulnerabilities, developers should implement proper access controls and authorization mechanisms. 

This includes:
- Ensuring that access controls are enforced on both the client and server sides.
- Using session-based or token-based authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- Implementing authorization checks at the object level, ensuring that users can only access resources they are authorized to.
- Avoiding direct object references in URLs and instead relying on indirect references or UUIDs.
