Mitigation: To prevent security misconfigurations related to default credentials, the administrator should:

- Change default passwords and credentials immediately after deployment.
- Implement a strong password policy, requiring complex passwords and regular password changes.
- Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to administrative access.
- Regularly audit and review system configurations to ensure they align with security best practices.
- Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users and processes only the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.
- Database credentials are loaded from a separate configuration file (config.php), which is not publicly accessible.
- SQL Injection Prevention: User input for the user_id parameter should safely handled using prepared statements, which protects against SQL injection attacks.
- Error Handling: Detailed error messages should logged securely, and generic error messages displayed to users, preventing potential information leakage.
