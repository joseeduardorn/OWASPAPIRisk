Mitigation: To address this issue and prevent Broken Function Level Authorization, the application should:
Implement proper authorization checks at the function or endpoint level to ensure that users can only access functionalities they are authorized to use.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms to determine user permissions dynamically based on their roles or attributes.
Ensure that sensitive operations, such as editing user profiles or performing administrative tasks, require appropriate authentication and authorization before allowing access.
Regularly audit and review access control mechanisms to identify and remediate any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
