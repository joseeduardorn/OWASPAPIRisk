Mitigation: To address this issue and prevent unrestricted access to sensitive business flows, the application should:
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to verify the identity of users before allowing access to sensitive functionalities.
- Enforce granular authorization checks to ensure that users are authorized to perform specific actions, such as transferring funds or viewing transaction histories.
- Apply principle of least privilege (PoLP) by granting users only the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks.
- Regularly audit and review access controls to identify and remediate any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to unrestricted access to sensitive business flows.
- Implement transaction monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to detect and alert on suspicious or unauthorized activities in real-time.
